#+TITLE: Not a Real Tachistoscope

But lot easier to come by and hopefully just as fun.

Try the [[https://tgetgood.github.io/tachi][demo]] and see for yourself!

* What am I looking at?
  A game that I hope will be fun. A game where you learn to see things faster
  and more dynamically.

  The difficulty autotunes based on your performace.

  I like games where you succeed by growing. Not the fictional character you
  play, but you yourself.
* Where does it come from?
  Inspired by the work of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Renshaw][Sam Renshaw]] before, during, and after WWII. See also
  [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223980.1945.9917254][this paper]].

  Adapted to modern screens with much lower reliablity than Renshaw's
  tachistoscopes (he trained some students to recognise a 7 digit number in only
  3Î¼s and claimed that anyone could be trained to recognise one in 0.5ms), but
  I'm hoping there will still be some advantage to memory, perception, and
  visual comprehension to be had with the 1/15 to 1/100 of a second duration
  that can be achieved on modern screens.
* Limitations
  Lots of factors contribute to how long it takes your monitor to display an
  image after it's been told to do so. The monitor, gpu, kernel, compositor, and
  browser are probably the big ones.

  I don't pretend to understand all of these factors or to be able to predict
  the performance of your setup. Some laptops need 4 frames at 60Hz to reliably
  blink an image without tearing, while my desktop can reliably display a single
  frame at 120Hz (on one of the screens, but not the other) without tearing.

  So I've included a slider in the game to set the minimum "blink time". If you
  push the space bar and swear that sometimes nothing happens, then you're
  probably right. Adjust the blink time until an image flashes every time.

  Note, if you want a harder game, try to tune it so that something always
  shows, but tearing makes it noisy. This isn't possible on all setups.

#+TITLE: Not a Real Tachistoscope

But lot easier to come by and hopefully just as fun.

* What am I looking at?
  A game that I hope will be fun. A game where you learn to see things faster
  and more dynamically.

  The difficulty autotunes based on your performace.

  I like games where you succeed by growing. Not the fictional character you
  play, but you yourself.
* Where does it come from?
  Inspired by the work of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Renshaw][Sam Renshaw]] before, during, and after WWII. See also
  [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223980.1945.9917254][this paper]].

  Adapted to modern screens with much lower reliablity than Renshaw's
  tachistoscopes (he trained some students to recognise a 7 digit number in only
  3Î¼s and claimed that almost anyone could be trained to recognise one in
  0.5ms), but I'm hoping there will still be some advantage to memory,
  perception, and visual comprehension to be had with the 1/15 to 1/100 of a
  second duration that can be achieved on modern screens.
* Limitations
  Due to a deep stack that I'm not going to pretend I understand in depth, it
  has proven impossible to reliably show an image for a single frame in a
  browser.

  It seems that setting the minimum time to 4 frames results in images showing
  every time without significant tearing, but obviously this hasn't been tested
  extensively.
* Difficulty Levels
  It's a game after all, so how do we make it harder as you go?
** Ideas
*** Length of number to memorise
    This is currently implemented, and for the life of me I can't get the 7
    digit numbers in 4 frames.
*** Length of exposure
    If you can't memorise a given number size, we should show you numbers of
    that size for a longer duration and then work to shorten that duration.
*** Radomise location of text
    If you don't know where the image will pop up it requires a more gestalt
    approach to seeing, which is the point. Will help improve size of perceptual
    field.

    Will this make a difference on a small screen?

    Do we move the numbers each time you get it right, or every retry as well?
    Is that something that should scale with difficulty?
*** Play with delay before flash
    Randomised delay prevents you from priming yourself. I think that's
    important, but I have no evidence as of yet.
*** Multiple numbers
    Show columns of numbers to memorise. Or to really be a jerk just put N
    numbers at random points on the screen.
*** The Element of Scorched Earth
    Add chaff to the mix. Put words or nonsense letters on the screen but you
    only need to memorise the numbers. This might just be frustrating.
*** Text
    Words, short sentences, even whole paragraphs with longer time lapse. The
    problem longer text with this is that we need comprehension tests since pure
    regurgitation isn't what anyone wants.

    What about nonsense text (jaberwock)? Garbage text (qweoasdafht)? You could
    probably publish a cool paper about memory profiles of real language vs
    syntactically/phonetically correct nonsense vs noise text. I don't know if
    it would be any fun for players though.
*** Image matching
    Show 4+ images and make the player figure out which are the same. They can
    creep together like Pavlov's circle & elipse if I feel sadistic.
*** Bird watching
    What bird did you just see? How many? which way were they going?

    Basically replicated Renshaw's work for the navy during WWII, but with
    birds.

    I think this would be fun and useful, but I'll need to find and label the
    images.
